Here is a notebook that concludes a data science course from Coding Nomads. I didn't love the course, but it was necessary to get familiar with the information before beginning the next course on deep learning. I'm excited to dive into neutral networks and scikit learn.

This prject uses Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the csv files are from kaggle.

simple set up

- set up env
- make sure you have pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
